      <h3>Dookie</h3>
      <h4>Green Day</h4>
      <p>Green Day released Dookie in 1994 which was received pretty well by the population and scene. Dookie brings a loud, chaotic, angsty punk sound that is driven by a fast pace. Some of my favorites from the album include Longview, Chump, Welcome to Paradise, Basket Case, F.O.D. and She. The song  Basket Case  is inspired by the singers experiences with anxiety attacks and dealing his emotions he had prior to being diagnosed with a mental disorder  Dookie itself has been one of the reasons punk had been brought into the mainstream and it can be seen today through their continuous playing as a band and releasing of albums to this day that now my fourteen year old sister rocks too. The album art is cluttered and depicts a monkey holding poop with the caption “ Throw?” as well as broken houses, people purging and in the center surrounding the title “Green Day” is a mushroom cloud of smoke from an explosion. All of these depictions really speak to the chaotic, edgy, punk sound that Green Day was giving off at the time,

      I remember having a poster up in my room with all the band members on it and singing the words to the first song I ever learned in first grade which was Boulevard of Broken Dreams by Green Day. It is funny thinking about how I used to sing these songs as a kid with little knowledge about the experiences or emotions that these songs were talking about. It had been my childhood dream to see them but they had never come to Milwaukee that I had known of. This year 2021 I was supposed to see Green Day on the Hella Mega Tour with Weezer and Fall Out Boy but instead of going I had to work at Zumiez because they didn’t schedule me off. I'll catch them next time.
