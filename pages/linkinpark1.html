      <h3>Meteora</h3>
      <h4>Linkin Park</h4>
      <p>Meteora was released by Linkin Park in 2003. It is safe to say that linkin park is one of the most influential and popular nu metal / alternative bands of the 21st century with around 16 million copies being sold. The themes and emotions behind the album include feelings of frustration, anger, recovery,  as well as a variety of other emotions. Singer Chester Bennington said “ We don’t talk  about situations, we talk about the emotions behind the situations. Mike and I are two different people, so we can't sing about the same things, but we both know about similar feelings and situations and can relate on some level.” Meteora captures these emotions perfectly with hard hitting sounds with emotionally driven lyrics. Singles from the album include “Somewhere I Belong”, “Faint”, “Numb”, “From the Inside” and “Breaking the Habit”. The track “Breaking the Habit” is a track that talks about substance abuse, particularly Mike Shinoda’s friend. This song carries very deep cut emotions that weren’t expressible for years of Mike Shinoda’s life.

      The album has a pretty rad graffiti look to it with a photograph of an artist spray painting a surface. The album has a unique inside that when opened completely reveals a photo of a wall of graffiti. The wall incorporates mostly cool colors such as blue and tans.  </p>

      <h3>Minutes to Midnight</h3>
      <h4>Linkin Park</h4>
      <p>Minutes to Midnight is Linkin Park’s third album released in 2007. Following its release it became number one on billboard charts in 16 countries and became a multi-platinum hit in multiple countries selling over 20 million copies across the globe. Although this is one of the most highly acclaimed Linkin Park albums and does hold memories it is probably one of the records I listen to least by them. The song “Bleed It Out” has many memories attached to it since in my childhood I sang it a lot on the videogame Rock Band and would perform the songs over and over again.

      The album's design is mainly black and white photos of the group. Both the front and back of the album include different pictures of the band looking out at the water into the horizon. The inside of the album has a landscape photo of the band which seems to be looking serious. The most interesting part of the packaging and design to me is the logo of the initials “LP” printed on the middle of the record. Some of the songs on the album are inspired by the true story of his discovery at the age of 17 that the man he thought his whole life was his father was not and that his real father had already died.  </p>
