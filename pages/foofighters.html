          <h3>Greatest Hits</h3>
          <h4>Foo Fighters</h4>
          <p>The Foo Fighters formed in Seattle, Washington, 1994 as a new project for Dave Grohl. Currently in 2021, the band's members consist of Dave Grohl, Nate Mendel, Pat Smear, Taylor Hawkins, Chris Shiflett and Rami Jaffee. Since 1994 the band has gone on to produce a number of hits such as “Everlong” which has become a 2x Platinum record. This record includes 16 of the most popular songs. Criticism has come from the band members who stated that it would have made more sense for the Greatest Hits album to come out after the band had retired as opposed to while they are still active. This statement makes sense considering the Greatest Hits album was released in 2009 and they are still releasing music and touring today.

          The song “The Pretender” is about speaking to the people who have been misled and lied to, the people who have been screwed over. The song hints at the political unrest of the time but Grohl has mentioned that he wants others to interpret the meanings of his lyrics and resonate with whatever he may be expressing. The song “My Hero” on the album reached number six on the US Alternative Songs Billboard chart. The song was written about everyday heroes like the people in our community. I related to this as a young teenager because I never idolized famous people or had someone I looked up to besides the people I could see who did right around me and who really did things in my life. People such as my father and mother, my great grandpa, the teachers and parents of my friends who I looked up to.  </p>
