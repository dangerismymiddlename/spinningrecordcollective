      <h3>Morning Views</h3>
      <h4>Incubus</h4>
      <p> Morning Views was released in 2001 and went double platinum. The alternative rock album includes popular singles such as “Wish You Were Here”, “Nice to Know you”, “Warning”, “Are You In?”, and “Circles”. The album is filled with chill alternative songs that entice deep thought and leave you hanging on each lyric.  The song “Wish You Were Here” is about the artist's acknowledgment of the brief fleeting moments in one's life and how sometimes in those moments we wish we had someone who would tell us “I love you” and that in those times we wish we had someone to share it with. Personally, this song reminds me of my late grandfather who I was close to. One thing this album does a good job at conveying is that we must live in the present and not the past or future.

      The album art on the outside of it includes photography. On the cover of the album is a picture of Malibu's shoreline with waves gently crashing against the shore. The backside of the album includes a list of the songs on the record with a photograph of the band members looking out at the ocean. This entire album makes me feel like I’m back in Hawaii cruising, hiking, surfing and enjoying island life. The art on the record itself includes a print of a koi fish that Brandon Boyd the singer of the band drew. The inside of the album includes the lyrics to the songs with pictures of the band members during the recording process in Malibu California.</p>

          <h3>Make Yourself</h3>
          <h4>Incubus</h4>
          <p>
            Make Yourself is the third album released by Incubus in 1999. The album encaptures genres such as alternative metal, alternative rock, as well as funk rock influences. Singles featured on the album include “Pardon Me”, “Stellar”, and “Drive”. Song has been featured in widely popular games such as Guitar Hero which showcase the song “Stellar”. Games such as Guitar Hero World Tour, Rock Band, and Guitar Hero Live features their song “Drive” which was also played in the movie Surf’s Up. The song “drive” has gained much popularity in its time ranking as their most listened to song also earning multiple awards and hitting billboards in multiple countries. Brandon Boyd, singer of Incubus commented on the meaning of the song “Drive” by stating "The lyric is basically about fear, about being driven all your life by it and making decisions from fear. It's about imagining what life would be like if you didn't live it that way".

            Another single of theirs, “Pardon Me” was written about how Boyd had recently returned from a tour to find out that his girlfriend of 7 years had been cheating on him, and that both his grandmother and a close friend of his had died. After seeing a picture in Life magazine of a man who had spontaneously combusted, he related the man's problems to his own and was inspired to write the lyric "Pardon me while I burst into flames" on his hand. This album's most prominent and intriguing noise that really stood out to me when first hearing it was the combination of DJ turntable scratching mixed with a nice alternative sound.
